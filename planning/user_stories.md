## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

We are going to develop a web app for tracking medication with an easy-to-use user interface that works for people of all ages and allows for caretakers to track the medication of loved ones or residents.


## User Roles

Regular user: a person looking for a web app to track and manange their medication(s)

Caretaker: someone who is trying to manage and track medication for their resident, family member, or friend

## User Personas

Regular user:
  Robert is about to be a junior in college. Along with other obligations as a young
  adult, it can be difficult to regularly track and take his medication. He takes 3
  different medications daily but one of them needs to be taken 3 times a day. He
  needs an app that he will have access to for his medicine, no matter what device 
  he is on because he is constantly moving around and running errands.
  
  Jeb is in his mid 60's and takes 5 medications daily. He is retired and really
  wants to make sure he does not miss a does. He doesn't own a smartphone but has an
  easy-to-use chromebook he rarely uses. He needs an simple web app to track his
  medication because it can be so easy to forget. Pen and paper are just not enough.
