## User Personas

Meducation user:
  Robert is about to be a junior in college. Along with other obligations as a young
  adult, it can be difficult to regularly track and take his medication. He takes 3
  different medications daily but one of them needs to be taken 3 times a day. He
  needs an app that he will have access to for his medicine, no matter what device 
  he is on because he is constantly moving around and running errands.
  
  Jeb is in his mid 60's and takes 5 medications daily. He is retired and really
  wants to make sure he does not miss a does. He doesn't own a smartphone but has an
  easy-to-use chromebook he rarely uses. He needs an simple web app to track his
  medication because it can be so easy to forget. Pen and paper are just not enough.
  
  Luis is 53 years old and he lives in the Texas suburbs. He takes 6 medications daily, some of them twice a day.
  He uses his phone and computer for work, but is not very tech savvy and prefers his computer.
  He is very forgetful regarding taking his medications and often can’t remember if he has taken them. He also
  finds it difficult to know whether new medications he gets will not interact well with all of the others he is taking.

Caregiver:
  Derek is 25 years old and lives in a suburb near his parents. He travels often for work and 
  along with his personal duties he has to check up on his mother to see if she is taking her prescribed medicine every day.
  He is very tech savvy and due to his travels, he always has his phone with him. He needs a system that notifies 
  him when she should be taking her medication so he can reach out to her to confirm.
  
  Amanda is a newly graduated caretaker for Jim. Along with her other duties she must remember to 
  give Jim his medications at certain times. As she's new to the job and doesn't know all the medication
  he takes off the top of her head she would like a system that has all the medications he takes and 
  notifies her when he should be receiving the medication. Due to her not always being in the house she would 
  like a system that can notify her even if she isn't in front of a computer.
