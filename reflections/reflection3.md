## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing we were able to accomplish this week was our timezone feature. Without having to rewrite a significant portion of code we were able to implement the ability for users to input their timezone when selecting a notification schedule. The time they select is updated within all other parts of the website and correctly corresponds to the timezone in which the user selected.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One challenge we faced was with our autocomplete dropdown for our medicine names. This feature would allow a user to start typing and then have a dropdown of possible medicine names filtered using their input. We struggled at first because we had no idea how to implement it. Then after we started using react-select, it kind of started working, however, it was very slow and the results were alphabetical rather than by closest match. After advice from our mentor to use a Trie datastructure, we managed to find a tutorial and other online resources to help build a dropdown that is fast and gives good selections.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were not able to implement all our features from this sprint. All of the features from this sprint are stretch features and were not needed to have a functional website. This sprint is incomplete because the few tasks that we did implement, we as a group deemed more important than the rest. The remaining tasks are quality of life implementations and are not that important.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The provided resources helped significantly in multiple aspects relating to our project. This was stated in last week's reflection, but the TA tutorial on how to use git was extremely helpful and a great resource to check from time. Also, having more TAs, office hours, and opinions from a professional UX/UI designer have proved to be valuable. TAs and Phineas have helped our group solve problems such as small, annoying bugs and deploying our website. Obi's opinions on our website were incredibly helpful because it was one of the first times we had another person try to navigate our website. Based on the comments we recevied, we made the appropriate adjustments. Also resources and ideas from our mentors, such as using a Trie data structure for our autocomplete, have been very helpful during on the presentaiton.



* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our "caretaker" idea is still a feature at risk. It is fine if this feature does not get developed in time because our website does not necessarily need it. We prioritized other features for this week including support for timezones within the United States, autosuggestions for medication names, and styling. We will continue to update our project issues based on what we feel will be possible to complete before the deadline.
