## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing that we were very proud to complete this week was adding a mobile view for our website. Currently, most of our website is responsive and looks good on mobile, which was a feature that we really wanted to have for our project. Another successful feature we were able to complete this week was the interaction checker. We did not expect to have it fully functioning yet, but we have it working and showing in the frontend.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We had a couple issues with merge conflicts but were able to work together to solve all of them. We have a procedure to follow when there are merge conflicts, which has proved to be very useful. We work throught each merge conflict together, talking through the changes we wan't to keep or delete and keep each other on the same page. Thankfully, merge conflicts are much easier to resolve due to the experience with have gained as a team. We also were challenged overall with using git. None of us had experience using git to develop a project with other people, so branches, merge conflicts and pull requests were something we had to learn.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

After some readjustments to our sprint, we were able to finish it this week. We had originally planned to have the notifications done this week, however, due to the complexity and rescheduled mentor meetings, we rearranged the order in which we will complete some features. Notifications will now be our biggest priority for sprint 2, along with the rest of the features we need to complete for our MVP.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources given to us by the CodePath team has prepared us for most aspects of the capstone project. we have referred back to multiple sources such as the videos made by Jeff Astor. His videos made setting the backend much easier. Also, every project we have done in the program has helped us sharpen our react skills. The git demos done by the TA's proved to be extremely helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I believe that our caregiver user stories are currently at risk. Throughout the course of our development, we realized that it is not as much of a priority as we originally had through and if we were to still implement a caregiver option, we would probably only keep the user stories allowing the caregiver to receive notifications regarding whether their charge has taken their medication.
