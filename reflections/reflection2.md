## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
One successful feature we added this week was our notifications! It is perhaps the most important function of our website, so being able to implement this feature was one of our greatest achievements. This feature allows a user to schedule when they want to receive their medication notifications, including when they want it repeated, such as everyday, every week, etc. It will then send a message to them using Twilio reminding them to take their medication.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
We had to overcome the the issue of sending notifications at specific times to any user. This is something that we overcame together as this was the probably the most difficult issue we had to address. Specifically, we had a hard time figure out how to automatically send the notifications at a specific time on a recurring basis, as Twilio did not have a way to that itself. Thankfully, the collaboration helped us complete notifications as a group. We also had to work outside of the program hours to make sure this would get done. We spent time researching cronTime, job schedulers, and other types of time and scheduling resources to figure it out.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
For this sprint, we were able to implement all of the core features we had planned. We completed the last issue on Thursday, which gave us time to polish our web app before the Friday demos. We were on time and planned our sprint properly as there was no issue that was left incomplete. This allows the group to focus on styling and stretch features for the coming week.


* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
Yes, one resource we received from a TA was node-schedule, an npm package that helped us schedule our notifications using the automated scheduled jobs and cronTime. Beyond this, our mentors had provided suggestions for us for styling. Some websites were recommended for us to check out such as bulma.io, material ui, and chakra ui and we have considered those, but they will now be more useful for the following week.


* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The caretaker option may be at risk currently because we have other priorities for this coming week. We are prioritizing styling, editing notifications and refactoring code to post individual notifications for schedules that are more specific. We also need to delpoy the website and bug test for differing timezones. In this case, all of our caretaker user stories will probably not come to fruition and at this point we don't know if we'll be able to implement any of them. We will probably need to review our user stories and update them with our current vision for our website, which has evolved since we originally created those user stories.
